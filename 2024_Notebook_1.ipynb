            "and said to her servant, \"Dismount, and bring me some water from yonder\n",

            "now she had power over her mistress, because with the loss of the lock\n",

            "of its ease, returned; but neither Cathy, nor the pony, nor the two\r\n",
            "pointers were visible in any direction: I despatched emissaries down\r\n",
            "this path, and that path, and at last went wandering in search of her\r\n",
            "myself. There was a labourer working at a fence round a plantation, on\r\n",
            "the borders of the grounds. I inquired of him if he had seen our young\r\n",

            "You may guess how I felt at hearing this news. It struck me directly\r\n",

            "making straight to the high-road. I walked as if for a wager, mile\r\n",
            "after mile, till a turn brought me in view of the Heights; but no\r\n",
            "Catherine could I detect, far or near. The Crags lie about a mile and a\r\n",
            "half beyond Mr. Heathcliff’s place, and that is four from the Grange,\r\n",
            "so I began to fear night would fall ere I could reach them. “And what\r\n",
            "if she should have slipped in clambering among them,” I reflected, “and\r\n",
            "been killed, or broken some of her bones?” My suspense was truly\r\n",
            "painful; and, at first, it gave me delightful relief to observe, in\r\n",

            "under a window, with swelled head and bleeding ear. I opened the wicket\r\n",
            "and ran to the door, knocking vehemently for admittance. A woman whom I\r\n",

            "got on; for he lived almost as secluded as Catherine herself, and was\r\n",
            "never to be seen. I could gather from her that he continued in weak\r\n",
            "health, and was a tiresome inmate. She said Mr. Heathcliff seemed to\r\n",

            "not do at all with his sitting in the same room with him many minutes\r\n",
            "together. There seldom passed much talk between them: Linton learnt his\r\n",

            "figure was both plump and slender, elastic as steel, and her whole\r\n",
